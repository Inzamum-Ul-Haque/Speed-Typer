          <h2>Q1. Tell the difference between local and session storage.</h2>
          <p>
            1. The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. The storage
            capacity of session storage is 5MB <br />2. It can be deleted via
            javascript or manually, on the other hand session storage is session
            based and works per window or tab, closing the tab or window will
            delete the data inside it automatically.

          <h2>Q2. Tell the difference between global and block scope.</h2>
          <p>
            1. Variable declare outside a function is called global scope.
            Variable declared inside a block of curly braces is called block
            scope. <br />
            2. Variables of global scope can be accessed anywhere from the file,
            on the other hand block scope variable can only be ccessed inside
            the block. <br />
            3. var is global scoped. Let and const are block scoped.

          <h2>Q3. How do the event loop works inside Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be
            clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call
            Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
            the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes
            it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again,
            and repeats the same process.

          <h2>Q4. How many ways we can get undefined?</h2>
          <p>
            There are 8 ways we can get undefined. <br />
            <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
            <li>Function with no return</li>
            <li>Parameter value that is not in function will be undefined</li>
            <li>
              If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined
            </li>
            <li>
              Property that does not exist in the object will give you undefined
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessing array elements outside of the array range will give
              undefined
            </li>
            <li>
              Deleting an element inside an array(should never do it in the
              first place)
            </li>
            <li>Set a value directly to undefined</li>
